Reflecting the trend to optimization through integrative approaches for engine, driveline and vehicle control, this valuable book enables control engineers to understand engine and vehicle models necessary for controller design and also introduces mechanical engineers to vehicle-specific signal processing and automatic control. Emphasis on measurement, comparisons between performance and modelling, and realistic examples derive from the authors\u2019 unique industrial experience . The second edition offers new or expanded topics such as diesel-engine modelling, diagnosis and anti-jerking control, and vehicle modelling and parameter estimation.
