From ornate Early Christian carving to the colorful green and brown glazed pottery that distinguished the city, this booklet shows how medieval Athens was a lively, bustling town with a rich artistic tradition. Finds and architecture from the private houses that covered over the remains of the classical city are discussed, and the book ends with a survey of the Church of the Holy Apostles, the 11th-century A. D. church that stands at the southeast corner of the Agora.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0876616074"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780876616079"}], "pageCount": 32, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["History", "History"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_2Xrtn1Q2YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_2Xrtn1Q2YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 25}
