Among the sequence analysis systems reviewed are GCG, Omiga, MacVector, DNASTAR, PepTool, GeneTool, and Staden. Molecular biology software includes Genotator and sequence-similarity searching using FASTA, CLUSTAL multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenic analysis. Web-based resources are examined for primary sequence databases, primary sequence analysis methods, and clinical databases useful in molecular medicine. The book also includes a set of guidelines for designing and teaching an introductory bioinformatics course and numerous illustrative examples to teach the reader how to solve problems. Bioinformatics: Methods and Protocols offers to experienced and novice biologists a broad overview of the computational tools that have reshaped modern biology. It constitutes a gold-standard reference for today's scientists who wish to develop and hone their bioinformatics skills towards the discovery of new biological relationships.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781592591923"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1592591922"}], "pageCount": 500, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback"], "categories": ["Computers", "Internet"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5l7Z0Rbyv0QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5l7Z0Rbyv0QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 43}
