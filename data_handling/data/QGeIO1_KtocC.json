If you\u2019re familiar with Arduino and have basic mechanical building skills, this book will show you how to construct a robot that plays sounds, blinks lights, and reacts to signals from an affordable electroencephalography (EEG) headband. Concentrate and the robot will move. Focus more and it will go faster. Let your mind wander and the robot will slow down. You\u2019ll find complete instructions for building a simple robot chassis with servos, wheels, sensors, LEDs, and a speaker. You also get the code to program the Arduino microcontroller to receive wireless signals from the EEG. Your robot will astound anyone who wears the EEG headband. This book will help you: Connect an inexpensive EEG device to Arduino Build a robot platform on wheels Calculate a percentage value from a potentiometer reading Mix colors with an RGB LED Play tones with a piezo speaker Write a program that makes the robot avoid boundaries Create simple movement routines", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781449311544"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1449311547"}], "pageCount": 77, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["Computers", "Computers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QGeIO1_KtocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QGeIO1_KtocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 36}
