She was under her three topsails, closely reefed; but even thus her tall masts bent, and twisted, and writhed, as if striving to leap out of her, while every timber and bulkhead fore and aft creaked and groaned, and the blocks rattled, and the wind roared and whistled through the rigging in chorus; and the wild waves rolled and tumbled the big ship about, making her their sport, as if she was a mere cock-boat. Stronger and stronger blew the gale; darkness came on and covered the world of waters, and through that darkness the ship had to force her way amid the foaming, hissing seas. Darker and darker it grew, till the lookout men declared that they might as well have shut their eyes, for they could scarcely make out their own hands when held at arm\u00d5s length before their noses.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781465596178"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1465596178"}], "pageCount": 264, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Sailors", "Adventure"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ItrGBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ItrGBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 24}
