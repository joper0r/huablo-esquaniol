The vastly improved spatial resolution and sensitivity has been utilized for studying everything from the magnetic fields of sunspots upto the internal dynamics of high-redshift galaxies. This thesis about AO science from small and large telescopes is divided into two parts: Robo-AO and magnetar kinematics. In the first part, I discuss the construction and performance of the world's first fully autonomous visible light AO system, Robo-AO, at the Palomar 60-inch telescope. Robo-AO operates extremely efficiently with an overhead", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781612334240"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1612334245"}], "pageCount": 218, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Science", "Science"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wOSVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wOSVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 19}
