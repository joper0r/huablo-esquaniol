Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a 'bloodhunter' whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a 'goblin' succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality- Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelg-nger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780099446729"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0099446723"}], "pageCount": 784, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Horror", "Horror"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cIn8Twm4MIkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cIn8Twm4MIkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 20}
