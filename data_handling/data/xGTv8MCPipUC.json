As email and audio/video conferencing technologies expanded the possibilities for education and social interaction, the authors played an active role in shaping and analyzing their use. Looking back on that early formative period and assessing its impact on the present world, the authors evaluate moments of social importance in order to examine the linkages among social practices, Alaskan peoples, and technologies. They consider the power of communication media to cause and ramify change.\"--BOOK JACKET", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415320623"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415320627"}], "pageCount": 198, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines", "Internet"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xGTv8MCPipUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xGTv8MCPipUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 34}
