Firstly, the book looks at the most important strategies that compelled the Chinese government to invest in the construction of the Internet infrastructure. Secondly, it examines the relationships between the development of the Internet in China and the emergence of a nascent civil society. Finally, attention is given to three different Chinese online platforms in three different historical periods. This three-pronged approach presents a coherent set of analyses and case studies which are committed to the investigation of the complex process of change undergone by Internet development in China.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319604053"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319604058"}], "pageCount": 247, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["Social Science", "Technology"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pH86DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pH86DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 6}
