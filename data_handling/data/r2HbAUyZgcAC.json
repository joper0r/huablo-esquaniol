While most studies of social movements focus on single-nation studies, Donatella della Porta uses a comparative research design to analyze movements in two countries--Italy and Germany--from the 1960s to the 1990s. Through extensive use of official documents and in-depth interviews, della Porta is able to explain the actors' construction of external political reality, and to build a theory on political violence that synthesizes the various interactions among political actors.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521029791"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521029797"}], "pageCount": 292, "printType": ["Paperback"], "categories": ["Political Science", "Politics"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r2HbAUyZgcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r2HbAUyZgcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 19}
