The Sixties and Beyond examines the scope and significance of dechristianization in the western world between 1945 and 2000. A thematically wide-ranging and interdisciplinary collection, The Sixties and Beyond uses a framework that compares the social and cultural experiences of North America and Western Europe during this period. The internationally based contributors examine the dynamic place of Christianity in both private lives and public discourses and practices by assessing issues such as gender relations, family life, religious education, the changing relationship of church and state, and the internal dynamics of religious organizations. The Sixties and Beyond is an excellent contribution to the burgeoning scholarship on the 1960s as well as to the history of Christianity in the western world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781442644755"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1442644753"}], "pageCount": 482, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["History", "History"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=shkOdzAqiDwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=shkOdzAqiDwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 14}
