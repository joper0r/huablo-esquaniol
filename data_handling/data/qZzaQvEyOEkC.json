Yet the Olympic movement was intended by Pierre de Coubertin, the central figure in the revival of the Olympic Games, to be based upon a philosophy, 'Olympism'. This book evaluates the moral project of Olympism, developing an analysis of the changing value positions adopted in relation to the ideology of Olympism from the 1890s to the present day. The book also explores contemporary concerns with youth, governance, sport for development and international relations.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780230289574"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0230289576"}], "pageCount": 305, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["History", "Sports"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qZzaQvEyOEkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qZzaQvEyOEkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 36}
