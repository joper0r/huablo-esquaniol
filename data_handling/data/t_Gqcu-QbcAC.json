In the midst of this distinguished career, he was also a famous and profound orator, delivering hundreds of orations across the nation, and at least five of the most important speeches in American history. In this book, Everett\u2019s training as an orator and his career on the public stage are reviewed in the context of his times, often referred to as the Golden Age of American oratory. Through analyses of a number of his most illustrious orations \u2013 such as the Phi Beta Kappa Society oration in 1824; his 4th of July oration at Worcester, Massachusetts; his eulogy to John Quincy Adams in 1848; his speech that saved Mount Vernon, \u00abThe Character of Washington\u00bb, delivered 137 times from 1856-1860; and his Gettysburg Oration, delivered just prior to Lincoln\u2019s illustrious Gettysburg Address \u2013 Everett is seen as a transformational figure. The book concludes that while unknown to most Americans, Everett\u2019s rhetoric of idealism, optimism, sentimentality, and conciliation provided the rising nation \u2013 America \u2013 with its sense of identity and its core principles.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1433110296"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781433110290"}], "pageCount": 166, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["History", "History"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t_Gqcu-QbcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t_Gqcu-QbcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 38}
