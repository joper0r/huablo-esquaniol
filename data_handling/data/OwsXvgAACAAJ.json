When mysterious Lorcan Reilly arrives in town with his \u201cniece,\u201d Eve, Tommin believes the fellow wants to help him. Instead, Lorcan whisks him off to the underground realm of the Leprechauns, where, alongside Eve, he\u2019s forced to prepare to become one of them. While Lorcan plots to use his \u201cgold-children\u201d as stepping-stones to the throne of the Leprechaun king, Tommin and Eve plan their escape\u2014and find themselves falling in love. But Tommin\u2019s humanity is slipping away, and unless Eve discovers the remedy in time, he\u2019ll be doomed to spend eternity as a thieving trickster.
