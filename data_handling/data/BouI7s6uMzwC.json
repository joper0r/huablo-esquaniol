Barker-Benfield documents the emergence of the culture of sensibility that transformed British society of the eighteenth century. His account focuses on the rise of new moral and spiritual values and the struggle to redefine the group identities of men and women. Drawing on the full spectrum of eighteenth-century thought from Adam Smith to John Locke, from the Earl of Shaftesberry to Dr. George Cheyne, and especially Mary Wollstonecraft, Barker-Benfield offers an innovative and compelling way to understand how Britain entered the modern age.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226037142"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226037141"}], "pageCount": 520, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["History", "History"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BouI7s6uMzwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BouI7s6uMzwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 46}
