This work examines the many ways that recent films have employed archetypal images, themes, symbols, and structural elements that originated in the most well-known Grimm fairy tales. The author draws similarities between the cannibalistic symbolism of the Grimm brothers' Little Red Cap and the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and reveals Faustian parallels between Rumpelstiltskin and the 1968 film Rosemary's Baby. Each of eight chapters reveals a similar pairing, and film stills and illustrations are featured throughout the work.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0786431741"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780786431748"}], "pageCount": 217, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["Literary Criticism", "Thrillers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n91kAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n91kAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 17}
