All you need is some experience with Arduino and Processing, the ability to connect basic circuits on a breadboard with jumper wire\u2014and you\u2019re good to go. You\u2019ll be guided through three hands-on projects that let you experience RFID in action. RFID is used in various applications, such as identifying store items or accessing a toll road with an EZPass system. After you build each of the book\u2019s projects in succession, you\u2019ll have the knowledge to pursue RFID applications of your own. Use Processing to get a sense of how RFID readers behave Connect Arduino to an RFID reader and discover how to use RFID tags as keys Automate your office or home, using RFID to turn on systems when you\u2019re present, and turn them off when you leave Get a complete list of materials you need, along with code samples and helpful illustrations Tackle each project with easy-to-follow explanations of how the code works", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781449324186"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1449324185"}], "pageCount": 28, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["Computers", "Computers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UeX46H4V0q8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UeX46H4V0q8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 49}
