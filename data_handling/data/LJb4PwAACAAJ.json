His genius: the ability to steal prototype weapons with unimaginable destructive powers, and leave no trace of their whereabouts. The weapons never appear on any black market. They're never used to wage a battle on US soil. And they're never sold to foreign agents. It's as if they simply vanish. But a top-secret CIA operation is one step ahead of the game. They know the next target. A company in Texas has developed a military combat uniform that renders a soldier virtually invisible. Optical camouflage offers limitless possibilities - and no one knows that better than CIA operative Steve Conway. But as Conway and his team set the trap for the elusive thief, things go terribly wrong. A hair-raising blend of mystery, manhunt and terror, WORLD WITHOUT END is an electrifying, page-turning novel of suspense by an author destined to join the ranks of the masters.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0743209249"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780743209243"}], "pageCount": 390, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Suspense fiction", "Thrillers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LJb4PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LJb4PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 22}
