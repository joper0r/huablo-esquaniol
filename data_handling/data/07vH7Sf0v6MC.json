The ArcGIS hydro data model is the latest innovation in GIS modeling and increases the potential to integrate data from many sources to solve a wider range of water resource problems. This guide shows how hydrology projects work and how they can work better: by integrating local, regional, national, and international data to create a deeper understanding of the earth's water problems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1589480341"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781589480346"}], "pageCount": 203, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Computers", "Technology"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=07vH7Sf0v6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=07vH7Sf0v6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 33}
