It challenges behavioral psychology to abandon many of the specific theoretical formulations of its most prominent historical leader in the domain of complex human behavior, especially in human language and cognition, and approach the field from a new direction. It will be of interest to behavior theorists, cognitive psychologists, therapists, and educators.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306476389"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "030647638X"}], "pageCount": 284, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback"], "categories": ["Psychology", "Computers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=89iIBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=89iIBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 22}
