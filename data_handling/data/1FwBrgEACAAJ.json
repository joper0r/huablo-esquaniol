Ash has stepped away form his former life of violence, living in Portland, working as a bouncer at a vegan strip club -- given Portland's genial atmosphere, he hasn't had to hit anyone in months, and he's quite happy about that. So when Crystal, one of the dancers, asks for help finding her daughter, Ash is hesitant. The girl, Rose, was snatched from daycare by Crystal's junkie ex-husband, and Crystal doesn't want to involve the cops. This job sounds like cake, but Ash reluctantly declines. A few hours later, Ash is tossed in a trunk, put on his knees behind a warehouse, and threatened at gunpoint to stay away from Rose. Unfortunately for his abductors, they don't realize that threatening Ash McKenna has the exact opposite effect from what they intended. Ash sets out to get the girl back. The hunt stretches from drug dens on the outskirts of town to the halls of government. City of Rose continues one of the most compelling new crime fiction series, by one of the freshest literary voices in the genre.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1940610516"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781940610511"}], "pageCount": 304, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Fiction", "Thrillers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1FwBrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1FwBrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 24}
