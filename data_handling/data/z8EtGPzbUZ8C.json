But then she defied her ruler, who cast her out and reshaped her in human flesh as punishment. She found refuge among the Wardens \u2013 and discovered that her perceived human weaknesses may be her greatest strengths. Living among mortals, Cassiel has begun to develop a reluctant affection for them \u2013 especially the intriguing Warden Luis Rocha. As the mystery deepens around the kidnapping of innocent Warden children, Cassiel and Luis are the only ones who can investigate within both the human and the Djinn realms. But the more Luis and Cassiel search, the more dangerous the trail becomes, reaching not only into a fanatical splinter group, but into the highest ranks of Cassiel's immortal kin. An outcast from her own kind, Cassiel must now rely on her own limited earthbound powers to save the young Wardens . . . if it's not already too late.
