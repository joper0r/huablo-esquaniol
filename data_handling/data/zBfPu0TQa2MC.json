The Post-Colonial Critic brings together a selection of interviews and discussions in which she has taken part over the past five years; together they articulate some of the most compelling politico-theoretical issues of the present. In these lively texts, students of Spivak's work will identify her unmistakeable voice as she speaks on questions of representation and self-representation, the politicization of deconstruction; the situations of post-colonial critics; pedagogical responsibility; and political strategies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415901707"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415901703"}], "pageCount": 168, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["Literary Criticism", "Politics"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zBfPu0TQa2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zBfPu0TQa2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 20}
