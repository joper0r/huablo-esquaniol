So he takes the brood under his wing--and the ragamuffin family miraculously captures his secretly lonely heart. Neither he nor Myla can deny there is an attraction, but both have too much pride to admit they need one another. Will God's loving grace show them that \"together\" they'd always be home for Christmas?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0373870442"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780373870448"}], "pageCount": 247, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Fiction", "Romance"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qGrU6R1o0o8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qGrU6R1o0o8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 43}
