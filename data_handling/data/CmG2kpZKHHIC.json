These are out of bounds to people like Bedford and his sister who live in an Unapproved Temporary Dwelling and have to scavenge from skips and bins just to stay alive. Bedford begins to notice something odd about the tourists: when they arrive in the city, they are desperately ill, but when they leave they seem to have been miraculously cured. And then the Dysfuncs start disappearing. It is only when a stranger appears, terribly injured, that Bedford begins to put two and two together . . . Rachel Anderson is a previous winner of the Guardian Children's Fiction Award.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0192750224"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780192750228"}], "pageCount": 144, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["Brothers and sisters", "Science+Fiction"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CmG2kpZKHHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CmG2kpZKHHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 45}
