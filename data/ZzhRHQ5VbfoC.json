A soft slippery nuzzle, the sort of sounds you'd expect a pig to make with its snout in a trough . . . The small mining town of Grymm perched on the very edge of the Great Desert is the kind of town you leave - but when Dad gets a three-month contract in the mine there, Mina and Jacob, unwilling stepbrother and sister, are reluctantly arriving. From a grotesque letting agent who seems to want to eat their baby brother, a cafe owner whose milkshakes contain actual maggots and the horribly creepy butcher, baker and candlestick-maker, Mina and Jacob soon realize that nothing in Grymm is what is appears to be. And then things get seriously weird when their baby brother disappears - and no one seems to even notice! In Grymm, your worst nightmares really do come true . . .", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781849415569"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1849415560"}], "pageCount": 391, "printType": ["Paperback"], "categories": ["Brothers and sisters", "Horror"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZzhRHQ5VbfoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZzhRHQ5VbfoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 31}
