Literature: overrated. Morality: expendable. Midnight is right for some over-the-top sex and violence, and this Grindhouse double feature is packing the aisles with blood 'n' guts! Check your good taste at the door, because Grindhouse is back, and it's meaner, badder and dirtier than ever, with two brand-new exploitation opuses from writer Alex de Campi (Smoke/Ashes [Dark Horse, 2013]). Celebrate your proclivity for freaky foulness with another volume in Grindhouse's flipbook series.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781616557713"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1616557710"}], "pageCount": 126, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Comics & Graphic Novels", "Horror"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rl7ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rl7ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 11}
