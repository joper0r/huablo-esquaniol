Maddie Cooper's did. She and her parents were gunned down in the street by an unknown assailant. Maddie's mother was killed and her Scotland Yard Inspector father was left in a wheelchair. Maddie was injured in the fall, her career as a dancer finished almost before it had begun. Searching for a new role in life, Maddie signs up as a trainee in her father's notorious flying squad: Police Investigation Command. PIC has a roving brief to combat crime in London and Maddie, quick-witted, intelligent and intuitive, is well-equipped to cope with the demands of her new job. She teams up with Alex Cox, an ace undercover man who can slip in and out of accents as easily as he does disguises, and Danny Bell, an electronics whizzkid with a razor-sharp mind. These three talented teenagers have the ability, courage, and technical know-how to fight crime, wherever it rears its ugly head on the streets of London.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0007148429"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780007148424"}], "pageCount": 240, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction", "Action"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qs9omwz0xakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qs9omwz0xakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 22}
