A world where bio-plagues are held suspended in a teardrop ... On an Earth where conventional armies are powerless to defend against the devastation wrought by single assassins, the secret organisation known as SPIRAL exists to fight a shadow war against fanatics and rogue states of every creed and political persuasion. Remorseless, unstoppable, of every country and of none, SPIRAL conducts its covert operations throughout the world in a never-ending battle for humanity's survival. But now SPIRAL itself is under attack, and if it falls the world falls with it.
