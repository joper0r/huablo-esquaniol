His ghost leads readers through the miasma of Soviet technology and industry, pointing out the mistakes he condemned in his time, the corruption and collapse he predicted, the ultimate price paid for silencing those who were not afraid to speak out. The story of this visionary engineer's life and work, as Graham tells it, is also the story of the Soviet Union's industrial promise and failure.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0674354362"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780674354364"}], "pageCount": 128, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback"], "categories": ["History", "Technology"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kHwx_UVw9ScC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kHwx_UVw9ScC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 30}
