The way history is studied at university level can vary greatly from history at school or as represented in the media and Doing History bridges that gap. Aimed at students of history in their final year of secondary education or beginning degrees, this is the ideal introduction to studying history as an academic subject at university. \"Doing History\" presents the ideas and debates that shape how we \"do\" history today, covering arguments about nature of historical knowledge and the function of historical writing, whether we can really ever know what happened in the past, what sources historians depend on, and whether the historians' version of history has more value than popular histories. This practical and accessible introduction to the discipline introduces students to these key discussions, familiarises them with the important terms and issues, equips them with the necessary vocabulary and encourages them to think about, and engage with, these questions. Clearly structured and accessibly written, it is an essential volume for all students embarking on the study of history\"--", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415565769"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415565766"}], "pageCount": 237, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["Education", "History"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PtBbrykak2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PtBbrykak2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 15}
