He was also one of the foremost political and economic theorists and one of the finest historians of the eighteenth century. His political essays reflect the entire range of his intellectual engagement with politics--as political philosophy, political observation and political history--and function as an extension of and supplement to works such as his Treatise of Human Nature and his History of England. The twenty-seven most important essays are presented in this fully annotated edition, together with excerpts from the History of England that point up their context.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521466393"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521466394"}], "pageCount": 346, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["History", "Politics"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5MEXDQ7pv8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5MEXDQ7pv8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 32}
