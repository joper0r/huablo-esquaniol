She's power-punching. She's back-flipping. Quick as a cat. Silent as a shadow. She's... over 70? When twelve-year-old twins Josh and Jessica visit their old gran in Tokyo things aren't quite what they expected. For starters, her flat is the most high-tech place they've ever been outside Dixon's. Suffice to say it makes them a little suspicious. But when their friend, popstar Kiki, is kidnapped and the twins set out to investigate they find themselves aided by a mysterious hooded ninja. But who is this shadowy crimefighter? None other than their gran!", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1409515109"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409515104"}], "pageCount": 149, "printType": ["Hardcover"], "categories": ["Adventure stories", "Action"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=13XIbwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=13XIbwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 21}
