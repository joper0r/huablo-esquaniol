It is the translated and revised edition of the Chinese version with the same title published by the Publishing House of Electronic Industry (PHEI) of China in 1994. The text is based on the graduate course lectures on \"Advanced Elec trodynamics\" given by the authors at Tsinghua University. More than 300 students from the Department of Electronic Engineering and the Depart ment of Applied Physics have taken this course during the last decade. Their particular fields are microwave and millimeterwave theory and technology, physical electronics, optoelectronics and engineering physics. As the title of the book shows, the texts and examples in the book concentrate mainly on electromagnetic theory related to microwaves and optoelectronics, or light wave technology. However, the book can also be used as an intermediate-level text or reference book on electromagnetic fields and waves for students and scientists engaged in research in neighboring fields.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783662035535"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3662035537"}], "pageCount": 669, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Science", "Science"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7DnvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7DnvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "super fast", "price": 9}
