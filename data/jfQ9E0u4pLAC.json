The Sciences of the Earth follow: geography and cartography, geology, seismology and mineralogy. Dr Needham distinguishes parallel traditions of scientific cartography and religious cosmography in East and West, discussing orbocentric wheel-maps, the origins of the rectangular grid system, sailing charts and relief maps, Chinese survey methods, and the impact of Renaissance cartography on the East. Finally-and here Dr Needham's work has no Western predecessors-there are full accounts of the Chinese contribution to geology and mineralogy.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521058015"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521058018"}], "pageCount": 926, "printType": ["Paperback"], "categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit", "Technology"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 50}
