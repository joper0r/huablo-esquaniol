A special chapter is designated to digital holographic interferometry with applications in deformation and shape measurement and refractive index determination. Applications in imaging and microscopy are also described. Spcial techniques such as digital light-in-flight holography, holographic endoscopy, information encrypting, comparative holography, and related techniques of speckle metrology are also treated", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540269113"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540269118"}], "pageCount": 164, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["Technology & Engineering", "Computers"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJEr3o4N7isC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJEr3o4N7isC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 35}
