When Zyra is captured by the Designers, Tark finds himself among a group of teenage rebels. It seems like everyone has an agenda, and Tark and Zyra are to be the pawns in other people's power games. They soon discover the sinister uses to which the game is being put and the shocking way it is all operated \u2013 with dozens of kidnapped children wired directly into the mainframe, their brains keeping the whole thing going. Will Tark and Zyra be able to free these children? Will they be able to save the characters within the game from the people who created them? Will they even be able to remain in the real world? Or will the Designers plans for world domination win out?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1921665971"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781921665974"}], "pageCount": 246, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Adventure"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SRRAlQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SRRAlQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 11}
