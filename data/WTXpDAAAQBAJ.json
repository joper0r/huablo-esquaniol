Everyone knows that Nathan is in love with his best friend, Preston...Everyone except Preston. Nathan has always accepted that Preston was too focused on his swim training to worry about love. But Preston is heading off to train for the Olympics soon, so if Nathan wants his chance at love, he has to speak up now. But saying \u201cI love you\u201d is surprisingly difficult, even for someone as confident as Nathan. Maybe a whirlwind vacation in Europe could help? But... what if it doesn\u2019t work out and he loses the best friend he\u2019s ever had?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781250100627"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1250100623"}], "pageCount": 256, "printType": ["Audiobook"], "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction", "Romance"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WTXpDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WTXpDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 15}
