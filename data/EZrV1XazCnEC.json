It covers 36 countries from five continents, analyzed by 87 contributors, so it offers a large comparative study. It is also a data bank of national information resources for students, researchers, policy-makers, sports leaders and managers. By means of a standard framework used in all chapters, the collected data from national cases on history, management and culture of sport provide interpretations of marketing, sponsorship, finance, target groups, settings for activities, strategy of promotion and social changes as related to Sport for All. This cross-national approach seeks to offer adequate meaning to the practices of each country, stimulating further research on specific themes of physical activities for health and leisure, either in affluent or poor social conditions. The concluding chapter lays the groundwork of Sport for All.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781841260853"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1841260851"}], "pageCount": 792, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Sports & Recreation", "Sports"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EZrV1XazCnEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EZrV1XazCnEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 6}
