When Minneapolis homicide cops Gino and Magozzi fish a body out of the Mississippi, they think it's just another day, another corpse. . . until a film of the victim's murder appears online alongside other films, also featuring brutal killings. Pretty soon they're asking themselves whether the murders are linked and, if so, whether this is the work of a lone killer . . . or several? Desperate to find a connection between the gruesome films before more are uploaded, Gino and Magozzi turn to computer maverick Grace MacBride for help. But as the bodies and videos stack up, the team creep closer to a terrifying truth with consequences for them all. Kill to play? Praise for PJ Tracy: 'Outrageously suspenseful.' Harlan Coben 'A fast-paced, gripping read with thrills and devlish twists.' Guardian 'A powerful thriller and an ingenious plot.'
