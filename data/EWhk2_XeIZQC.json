Using Lacanian psychoanalysis with feminist epistemology, the author sets out a groundbreaking psychoanalytic social theory. Campbell's work offers answers to the important contemporary question of how feminism can change the formation of gendered subjectivities and social relations. Drawing on the work of third wave feminists, the book shows how feminism can provide new political models of knowing and disrupt foundational ideas of sexual identity. Kirsten Campbell engages the reader with an original intepretation of Lacanian psychoanalysis and offers a compelling argument for a fresh commitment to the politics of feminism. Jacques Lacan and Feminist Epistemology will be essential reading for anyone with interests in gender studies, cultural studies, psychoanalytic studies or social and political theory.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415300878"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415300872"}], "pageCount": 209, "printType": ["Paperback"], "categories": ["Social Science", "Politics"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EWhk2_XeIZQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EWhk2_XeIZQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 7}
