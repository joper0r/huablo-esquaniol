By drawing on Slavoj Zi\u017eek's theory of ideology the author examines postmodern horror films like Jonathan Demme's \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" multiculturalism, post-September 11 political discourses and the society of enjoyment in terms of paranoia and perversion and reveals patterns of enjoyment structured through ideological fantasy. The Lacanian/Zi\u017eekian theory of ideological fantasy and ethics of psychoanalysis is then applied to broader philosophical, political and cultural contexts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3039112457"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783039112456"}], "pageCount": 187, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Psychology", "Horror"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PLq0q53zBk4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PLq0q53zBk4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "fast", "price": 45}
