The movement towards this new governance paradigm has been strongest in areas of public policy involving global networks of stakeholders, too intricate to be represented by governments alone. Nowhere is this better illustrated than on the Internet, where it is an inherent characteristic of the network that laws, and the behaviour to which those laws are directed, will cross national borders; resulting not only in conflicts between national regimes, but also running up against the technical and social architecture of the Internet itself. In this book, Jeremy Malcolm examines the new model of multi-stakeholder governance for the Internet regime that the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) represents. He builds a compelling case for the reform of the IGF to enable it to fulfil its mandate as an institution for multi-stakeholder Internet governance.\"--Provided by publisher.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780980508406"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0980508401"}], "pageCount": 611, "printType": ["Paperback", "Hardcover"], "categories": ["Law", "Internet"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G8ETBPD6jHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G8ETBPD6jHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 35}
