{"id": "XxFtDWMjN98C", "title": "The Power in the Writer", "subtitle": "Collected Essays on Culture, Democracy & Development in Africa", "authors": ["George Ngwane"], "publisher": "African Books Collective", "publishedDate": "2008", "description": "The book examines the creative industries of Cameroon and Africa and makes bold the cultural triumphant assertion that Africa is home to some of the most diverse cultural patrimony and the most versatile creative professionals. It also discusses indigenous development models and questions the rationale for Eurocentric democratic paradigms which have partly contributed to the demise of a concrete democratic development entitlement in most African countries. Ngwane weaves both the cultural and political strands into a search for a homegrown development web which he calls 'glocalisation'. Ngwane's essays, most of which have animated debate and discourse in national newspapers, online blogs and International journals are lucid in their arguments, poignant in their ideological focus, rich in their non-fiction craftsmanship and urgent in their message delivery. The essays will make good reading for students of Africa studies, Development studies, Politics and Culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789956558377"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9956558370"}], "pageCount": 185, "printType": ["Paperback"], "categories": ["Social Science", "Politics"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxFtDWMjN98C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxFtDWMjN98C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 35}
