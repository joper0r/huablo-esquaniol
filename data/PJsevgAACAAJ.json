Thanks to her older siblings, Lady Penelope Tidemore is no stranger to scandal. In order for her to make a good match, her secret longings for intrigue and romance must be quelled. Yet it is through terrible mischance that Penelope is caught in a compromising position--however innocent--with the darkly enigmatic viscount Ryker Black. Mr. Black is no gentleman. Raised from the streets and proprietor of the most notorious gaming hell in London, Black lives in a world filled with debauchery and danger. Taking a Society wife from the very ton he despises is not part of his plan, even if the innocent Penelope turns his blood hot with desire. But Penelope isn't afraid of Mr. Black, and she soon discovers that his reputation as a scoundrel may be designed to hide a surprising vulnerability. As this unlikely husband and wife grow closer, they learn that what started as chance could end up sealing their fates.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1503943437"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781503943438"}], "pageCount": null, "printType": ["Audiobook", "Paperback"], "categories": ["Fiction", "Romance"], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PJsevgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=public", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PJsevgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=public"}, "language": "en", "deliveryOption": "normal", "price": 28}
